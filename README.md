**This project was made as a school assignment and has no real purpose!**

# OpiNet

OpiNet (opinion net) is an imaginary opinion sharing social media platform, where anyone can create an account and then upload posts, up/downvote and comment posts
of other people.

This project has no purpose as it directly interacts with the database, which makes no sense. Not for use!
